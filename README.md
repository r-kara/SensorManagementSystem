## Project Objectives

The aim is to develop a small software system from formal requirement specification to implementation. The collection of technical artifacts must be developed in order and must be consistent with each other. The design artifacts must align with analysis artifacts, and the implementation artifacts must align with design artifacts.

The system is described informally and visualized subsequently as follows:
- A system maintains a number of sensors in a registry. Some of the sensors are deployed, each in a unique location, in order to read the locationâ€™s temperature.
- All locations of interest are marked on a map and maintained in a registry. Each location will be addressed by a single sensor.
- In addition to the above two registries, the system maintains two tables: One table contains all sensor-location pairs and another table contains all sensor-temperature pairs.

## Important points

The finalized artifacts have been put in two folders in the repository in order to increase the clarity of our final submission. The development process of each iteration phase can be found in the Issues section. Everything was posted there, meaning that there may be mistakes that we made but kept for proof of meeting the deadlines. For example:
- We initally believed that we needed to provide both types of interaction diagrams for each method (sequence diagram and communication diagram). Please disregard the communication diagrams as they have been left out and consider only the final sequence diagrams.
- We misunderstood the new system feature to implement in Iteration 2 and interpreted it as "removeSensor(..)" only instead of "replaceSensor(..). This means that the early design diagrams we developed were for the wrong method. This error has been corrected.
- We may have edited design artifacts after implementing their methods, but only when the changes were for errors that only affected the diagram and not the code, such as a duplicate object in a sequence diagram.

Overall, the project was divided relatively equally, and everyone on the team contributed to each phase. An artifact posted by one member does not mean that they were the only one working on it. This project was challenging, but very interesting and insightful. :)
